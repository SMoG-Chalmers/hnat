# Habitat Network Analysis Tool

Habitat Network Analysis Tool is a plugin for the open-source Geographic Information System QGIS (https://qgis.org/en/site/). The plugin is written in Python and uses QGIS GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) and GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) via the QGIS processing framework for some of its calculations. The plugin adds a processing algorithm to the QGIS Processing Toolbox, which means it can be used either directly from the QGIS Processing Toolbox or in QGIS Modeler.  

The tool supports analyses of species habitat networks with the capacity of supporting a multi-species approach. It is developed within the ongoing project ‘Development of a digital tool for integrated impact assessment of social, economic, ecological and cultural-historical values in transport infrastructure planning in urban environments’ (short name is ILKA 2.0) financed by the Swedish government research funding agency FORMAS (Dnr FR -2021/0004). The project is funded within the Swedish national research framework "From research to implementation for a sustainable society 2021". 
It aims to create a practical software where socio-economic, ecological and cultural historical analyses can be integrated when exploring effects of urban transformations, with specific focus on different types of alterations of the transport infrastructure. For the background of the project see:
